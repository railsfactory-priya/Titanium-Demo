</p><h1 id="section1">OLD TOWN</h1>
<h2>Historical Stockholm
  <font size="-1"></font></h2>
<br>
<font size="-1">
<p></p>
The story of Stockholm begins on the little island of Stadsholmen in the 11th century.
Today, the island is the site of Old Town, whose narrow lanes offer visitors a cheerful mix of medieval and modern. </font>
<h2 id="section2">The birth of Stockholm</h2>
<p><font size="-1">In the early Middle Ages, merchants wishing to reach the inland trading centers were forced to pass close to the islands on which Stockholm sprang up, and it was thus strategically important to protect the young city therefore, log pilings were driven into the surrounding waters in an effort to control waterborne traffic entering and leaving Lake Mälaren. A combination of the Swedish words stock (log) and holme (islet) is said to have given rise to the name Stockholm – although scholarly opinion is divided on this point. </font></p>
<font size="-1">
<p></p>
<p><br>
  In 2002 Stockholm celebrated its 750th anniversary. The name Stockholm is first encountered in written form in 1253, although it is likely that some sort of building or stronghold had been put up at this strategic site much earlier. The Erik’s Chronicle , dating from about 1330, states that Stockholm was built as a protection against Baltic invaders and Birger Jarl has thus come to be regarded as the city’s true founder. </p>
</font>
<p>
</p><h2 id="section3">STADSHOLMEN – THE HEART OF THE CITY</h2>
<p><font size="-1"> By the late 13th century Stockholm had become a centre of both commercial and political power, with a fortified castle on whose ruins today’s Royal Palace was later to be built. A wall, running approximately in the direction of the modern streets of Västerlånggatan and Österlånggatan , almost certainly surrounded the city. As
Stockholm grew, new streets were built to link the city quays outside the walls.
	Inside the walls, streets were often named after various trades carried on there. Köpmangatan (Merchants’ Street) and Skomakargatan (Cobblers’ Street) are the oldest documented names, dated 1323 and 1337, respectively. Foreign craftsmen and tradesmen, mostly from Germany and Finland, were also attracted to the city. While wealthy merchants tended to settle round today’s Skeppsbron and Järntorget, craftsmen and artisans set up on the city heights and over towards the north-west. In essence, the Old Town is still very much what it was then – arts and crafts and small shops galore. Owing to its historical atmosphere, the Old Town is a popular destination for Stockholmers, and it’s a must for tourist. </font></p>
<font size="-1">
<p></p>
</font>
<p>
</p><h2 id="section4">MEDIEVAL CELLAR VAULTS</h2>
<p><font size="-1">The streets were first paved with stone during the late Middle ages, and, to minimize the risk of fire, wooden buildings were forbidden; two or three-storey houses of brick and stone, with underground cellars, were put up instead, and house-owners were required to keep a barrel of water outside their property at all times. They were also expected to keep the streets clean – at that time, most rubbish is thrown directly out into the street. <br>
	Some of the medieval cellars still exist, many of them today housing pubs and restaurants offering everything from simple Swedish home-style cooking to international cuisine. Sometimes a strolling minstrel will drop by, taking you right back to the Stockholm of 18th century. In the afternoon, why not enjoy a freshly made waffle or a cup of hot chocolate, topped with whipped cream, in one of the cellar cafés? Or, of course, you can explore the shops that have now gone underground. Although Stadsholmen had been fully developed by the late 16th century, the city’s expansion on the outer islands remained slow. <br>
</font></p>
<font size="-1">
<p></p>
</font>
<p>
</p><h2 id="section5">IMPOSING PALACES</h2>
<p><font size="-1">Between 1636 and 1765, trade restrictions forced Bothnian merchants to export their wares via Stockholm, and the city rapidly grew. Most of the city’s wealthy wholesalers established themselves in the magnificent houses that now flank Skeppsbron.<br>
	During the 17th century when Sweden became a great power, the King and nobility tightened their grip on the city’s administration, building imposing palaces to reflect their authority and show that Stockholm was now the capital of a nation to be reckoned with. As many as 32 of the original 50 or more palaces still stand today, including the lovely Tessin Palace at Slottsbacken.<br>
 	A number of customs stations sprang up all around the city, so that even today Stockholmers refer to places as lying “inside or outside the customs”. </font></p>
<font size="-1">
<p></p>
</font>
<p>
</p><h2 id="section6">STADSHOLMEN BECOMES THE OLD TOWN</h2>
<p><font size="-1">Towards the end of the 19th century, businesses began moving from Stadsholmen to Norrmalm and the newly built harbours to the north of the city, leaving the old customs stations and warehouses empty. Over the last few years, many of these have been taken over by restaurants and shops.<br>
	As Sweden industrialised, the islands round the city were build over and the population grew rapidly. During the 20th century, with property prices rising, expansion continued well beyond the inner islands, and Stadsholmen, already reduced to the status of “the town between the bridges”, became simply known as “The Old Town”.<br>
At the end of the 19th century, plans for the introduction of new forms of transport, e.g. the railway, led some city planners to consider a total renewal of the Old Town’s buildings and streets. Fortunately for us all, these plans were never realised and the Old Town was saved for posterity.
</font></p>
<font size="-1">
<p></p>
</font>
<p>
</p><h2 id="section7">THE ROYAL PALACE</h2>
<p><br>
  <font size="-1">In the 13th century, a fortified keep was raised on the site of the present-day Royal Palace, a location that has always been of great strategic importance to the city. Tradition has it that the castle was named Tre Kronor (Three Crowns) in the mid-14th century as a symbol of the three realms that then made up the Kingdom Sweden.<br>
	By the mid-17th century the castle had outlived its use as a fortification and became the workplace of Sweden’s political Èlite until destroyed by fire in 1697. A new castle – the present-day palace – designed by Nicodemus Tessin was erected in its place. It was completed in 1748.<br>
	The Royal Palace is the official residence of the Swedish royal family. Guided tours are available to some parts of the palace – see the crown jewels in the Treasury and visit the Royal Armoury and Palace Museum, where parts of the old castle’s original foundation can still be seen.<br>
    The changing of the Royal Guards takes place in the outer courtyard of the Royal Palace in the Old Town.</font></p>
<font size="-1">
<p></p>
</font>
<p>
</p><h2 id="section8">THE CATHEDRAL – AS OLD AS THE CITY ITSELF</h2>
<p><br>
  <font size="-1">Stockholm cathedral is first documented in a will dated 1279, in which it is described as “Stockholm’s great church”. Eventually it became known simply as the City Church and was dedicated to Nicholas, patron saint of mariners and merchants. It was built at the city’s highest point, close to the old castle, and was successively enlarged during the 14th and 15th centuries.<br>
With the construction of the new Palace close by, the cathedral was considered too medieval in appearance and extensive changes were made. The cathedral was further renovated in the following centuries, with new windows being added in the 1860s and 1920s.<br>
 	The cathedral also houses the famous “Parhelion Picture”, a 17th century copy of a 1535 painting of the mock suns that appeared in that year above medieval Stockholm.
</font> </p>
<p></p>
<p>
</p><h2 id="section9">STORTORGET SQUARE </h2>
<p><br>
  <font size="-1">Stortorget has been everything from a place of execution to a lively market. During the 1650s the pump that stands in the middle of the square was the city’s only public supply of drinking water and the square itself came to be regarded as the true centre of the city. The City Hall was situated here until the 1670s, as was the Stock Exchange in the early days of stock trading. The Stock Exchange building now houses the Nobel Museum. That the square is today a popular meeting place is evident from the many cafés that lie here. At Christmas time it is jam-packed with market stalls selling a huge variety of Christmas goodies.</font> </p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>
</p><h2 id="section10">KUNGSHOLMEN</h2>
<p><font size="-1">The entrepreneur’s paradise</font></p>
<p>
</p><h2 id="section11">FROM MUNKLÄGRET TO KUNGSHOLMEN</h2>
<p><font size="-1">The islands west of the city proper is one of Stockholm’s youngest districts. Back in the 15th century it was home to the Franciscan monks, which is why it was then known as Munklägret (Monk Camp). The monks fished, reared cattle and ran brickworks at Rålambshov until they were expelled from the island during the 16th century, when Kungsholmen became the property of the king.
</font></p>
<p><font size="-1">Now crops were grown and the burghers, along with hunting, were allowed to graze their cattle on the island. Soon, however, another brickworks was established to produce the bricks needed for the Castle and the imposing new palaces that were going up in 17th-century Stockholm. Hence, the brickworks laid the foundations of the Kungsholmen to come and set it off on its long industrious career.
 </font></p>
<p><font size="-1">In the mid-17th century Munklägret was donated to the city as a place where manufacturers of hazardous or foul-smelling products could pursue their trades tanners, dyers and rope makers were among those attracted to the island by tax reductions and other privileges. As a result, Kungsholmen was quickly built over by the country residences, sometimes with magnificent gardens. Today’s Piperska Muren, for example, is a remnant of the walled garden that once surrounded Count Piper’s elegant pleasure grounds by presentday Scheelegatan. Like many other districts of the city at this time, the island was cleared and laid out with a grid network of roads and streets. Fleminggatan and Hantverkargatan both dated from this period. It was not until the end of the 17th century that Munklägret was rechristened Kungsholmen (King’s Island), owing to its situation between the royal properties of Riddarholmen and Drottningholm.
</font></p>
<p><font size="-1">By the middle of the 18th century Kungsholmen’s grand properties were being converted into factories and hospitals, making the island a centre of craft and industry. Serafimerlasaretten, Stockholm’s first hospital, was erected in 1792, on the property of the Gripenhielm residence – the inscription “Kongl. Lazaret” (Royal Hospital) can still be seen on the entrance gate.
</font></p>
<p><br>
</p><h2 id="section12">AN ISLAND OF INDUSTRY</h2>
<p><font size="-1">The Freedom of Trade Act of 1864 gave all citizens the freedom to carry on a trade and simulated a new business dynamic and a flourishing industrial base. Over the next few decades, Kungsholmen and Södermalm boasted more industries that anywhere else in Stockholm.
</font></p>
<font size="-1">
</font><p><font size="-1">With labour streaming in, the island’s population soon trebled in size and Kungsholmen came to be referred to as Svältholmen, or Starvation Island, and numerous blocks of flats were put up to set offset the housing shortage. Large engineering companies, such as Bolinders Mekaniska Verkstad and the Owen Shipbuilding company, set up on Kungsholmen, while Sweden’s first steam driven mill, Eldkvarn, was erected at the site of presentday City Hall. Kungsholmen was also the site of the city’s larges brewery.
</font></p>
<p><font size="-1">Industries built up round new inventions – LM – Ericsson, AB Seperator, Primus, Electrolux – also came to Kungsholmen, putting up modern new housing to accommodate the workers and their families. High quality lodgings were seen as a means of promoting high moral standards and hence, it was thought, of boosting production capacity.
</font></p>
<p><font size="-1">During the 1929s the housing shortage became acute. Many of the Swedish buildings ideals introduced during the thirties, stressing functionality and space, were applied in practice on Kungsholmen, where many such buildings can still be seen today. As a result, Kungsholmen and especially the newly renovated Norr Mälarstrand, became a relatively exclusive part of the city. With the building of Västerbron – linking Kungsholmen and Södermalm – and various other bridges, the circle was closed and Kungsholmen became an integral part of the city proper.
</font></p>
<p><font size="-1">
</font></p>

<p><font size="-1"><br>
  </font>
</p><h2 id="section13">CITY HALL</h2>
<p><font size="-1">In 1878 Eldkvarn mill was destroyed by fire and the site was reserved for the construction of a new City Hall. Architect Ragnar Östberg’s new building was completed in 1923; some 8million bricks went into its construction. </font> </p>
<p></p>
<p><font size="-1"> City Hall is Stockholm’s principal administrative building, though abroad it is better known for the Nobel Prize ceremonies held each year in the Blue Hall and Golden Hall. The Blue Hall is actually not blue at all, since Östberg eventually chose to leave the high brick walls as they were rather than colouring the blue. The interior of the Hall is richly decorated – in the walls of the Golden Hall, over 18 million glass and gold mosaic tiles glitter and gleam.
<p><font size="-1">The two copper doors leading into the Hall weigh over one ton each.  A good idea of City Hall’s sheer size can be gained from the inner courtyard, and there is a spectacular view of Riddarfjärden from the garden. However, one of the best views of the city can be enjoyed from the tower, which stands 106 metres above the water. Guided tours of the City Halls are available for tourists.
</font></p>
<p><font size="-1"><br>
  </font>
</p><h2 id="section14">FASHIONABLE NORR MÄLARSTRAND</h2>
<p><font size="-1">During the construction of City Hall, the decision was made to clean up and renovate Norr Mälarstrand, which was still lined with old industrial buildings, thereby opening up communications with Bromma and the new suburbs to the west.
</font></p>
<font size="-1">
</font><p><font size="-1">In 1930 a new city plan was adopted and Norr Mälarstrand became one of the city’s most fashionable streets. Grand houses were built along Riddarfjärden and, somewhat later, a shoreside track was laid out that is still much loved by walkers and cyclists. Today, many people like to set off from Norr Mälarstrand for a brisk winter walk over the ice down to City Hall.
 </font></p>
<p><font size="-1"><br>
</font>
</p><h2 id="section15">THE UNDERGROUND</h2>
<p><font size="-1">Public transport first came to Stockholm in the 19th century. The town was growing ad so were distances. Horsedrawn omnibuses (taking eight passengers) made their appearance in 1835, followed later by trams, driven first by steam, then by electricity. The first motor buses were introduced in 1923 and took fares all around the city.
</font></p>
<p><font size="-1">The big breakthrough came with the Underground in the early fifties, one of the first stations being at Kungsholmen’s Fridhemsplan. Later, as new lines were opened, the underground system came to cover almost all of the city. <br>
	Quite early on it was realised that the underground stations needed some form of embellishment and as many as 21 artists were invited to participate in a pilot project at
T-Centralen station, where they decorated walls, pillars, platforms and ceilings. The project was not entirely successful, however; the décor was incoherent and distracted from the traveling public’s appreciation of individual works. Future projects adopted a more uniform approach.
</font></p>
<p><font size="-1">Within just a few years, each station of the Stockholm Underground network would boast of having a distinct artistic profile of its own, from Siri Derkert’s sketch-like drawings in the concrete of Östermalmstorg to the archaeological excavations at Kungsträdgården, the chronological axis of historical events at Rissne, and the billowing orange ceramic staves at Zinkensdamm. Visitors to Stockholm can take guided tours to study the artwork of the many stations.
</font></p>
<p><br>
</p><h2 id="section16">THE NEW KUNGSHOLMEN</h2>
<p><font size="-1">Modern Kungsholmen is very much a product of – those who now live there. A new generation of wealthy young professionals has moved in over the past few years, sparking exciting new developments and rejuvenating what had previously been a rather staid part of town. Near Fridhemsplan, once a rundown, heavily trafficked square, a luxury new shopping mall, Västermalmsgallerian, has recently opened, while homes round Kungsholmstorg, Pontonjär-gatan and up on Kungsklippan are quickly snapped up by the new arrivals. Along Scheelegatan, restaurants, cafés and bars abound, some of the decidedly creative. In short, Kungsholmen today offers a stimulating mix of green areas, fine shops and cosy restaurants. Could it be that because Kungsholmen is still relatively young there are more chances for residents to make the island their own? Is that where its attraction lies?
</font> </p>
<p></p>

<p>
</p><h2 id="section17">ÖSTERMALM</h2>
<p><br>
  <font size="-1">Aristocrats and diplomats </font> </p>
<p></p>
<p>
</p><h2 id="section18">FROM ARSENAL TO STATELY APARTMENTS</h2>
<p><br>
  <font size="-1">Today’s Östermalm was long called Ladugårdslandet; it belonged to the Crown and was used for military manoeuvres and the provision of certain services on Sibyllegatan, for example, lies the old late 16th century Royal Bakery, which today houses the Music Museum. The next-door Army Museum was once used for the maintenance and repair of artillery pieces and is now the point of departure for the soldiers marching to the Royal Palace for the changing-of-the-guard ceremony. <br>
 	Östermalm has always  been associated with the military. In the 17th century it was the site of the royal arsenal (other weapons were stored in the Royal Palace), and even today it is home to the Armed Forces Staff College, the Royal Stables and other military institutions. It was not until 1885 that Ladugårdslandet was renamed Östermalm. During the 19th century, Östermalm was taken over by the Stockholm upper classes, who, around 1900, started to erect the grand five-storey buildings that have been typical of Östermalm ever since; there are only a few buildings of later date. This part of the city is thus extremely homogenous in style. Here is it not uncommon to bump into celebrities – an actress, perhaps, on her way to the Dramatic Theatre. There are also many exclusive restaurants in the area.<br>
	Although Östermalm in no longer an exclusive upperclass preserve, it nevertheless lacks the motley street life of other parts of town. Östermalm, so to speak, where one resides.
</font> </p>
<p></p>
<p>
</p><h2 id="section19">STOCKHOLM’S MOST EXCLUSIVE SHOPPING AREA</h2>
<p><br>
  <font size="-1">Reflecting its upper-class origins, Östermalm is where you’ll find the most exclusive shopping districts in Stockholm: Birger Jarlsgatan, Sibyllegatan, Nybrogatan, Grev Turegatan, Sturegatan and Karlavägen to name just a few. Many of the best shopping streets meet at Stureplan, where the Sture-gallerian shopping mall draws large crowds to its luxurious shops and restaurants. The “mushroom” shelter at Stureplan has long been a favourite meeting-place for Stockholmers.
</font> </p>
<p></p>
<p>
</p><h2 id="section20">SMELLY HERRING ALONG STRANDVÄGEN</h2>
<p><font size="-1">Modern Strandvägen’s posh houses and broad avenues do nothing to recall the warehouses packed with stinking fish barrels that once lined the quays. For it was here that salted herring shipped in to the city was transloaded for further distribution.
<br>
 	During the 18th century the city’s quays were given a much needed facelift, but it was not until the mid-19th century that the situation at Strandvägen was radically improved. In 1861 the decision was taken to undertake major renovation of the quay at Nybroviken, sparked partly by worries from ship owners that they would otherwise be outcompeted by the new railways. Along the new quay now ran an imposing avenue conceived in accordance with contemporary urban planning ideals – Strandvägen.
<br>
  </font><br>
</p>
<h2 id="section21">PARKS AND BOULEVARDS</h2>
<p><br>
  <font size="-1">With the advent of industrialism, Stockholm developed rapidly, and towards the end of the 19th century the need for a new regulatory city plan became acute. Proposals were made for great boulevards crossing the city in all directions, running along the quays and skirting city borders. Strandvägen was the first to be built, and there were plans for many more. However, most were never realised, although those boulevards that were built are today to be found mostly in Östermalm, Karlavägen, with its hub at Karlaplan, Narvavägen and Valhallavägen are just some of them.<br>
	Parks were also considered an important part of the townscape and worthy of the planners’ attention. Humlegården, for example, had long been the royal hopgarden and was converted into a park; it is one of Stockholm’s oldest parks and it is also the site of the Royal Library. <br>
 	The area north of Valhallavägen was previously completely undeveloped but during the late 19th century was chosen as the site of various new hospitals and colleges. Today, Valhallavägen is flanked by the Royal Institutes of Technology, the Academy of Music and the Armed Forces Staff College, making it something of the true academic heart of the city.
</font> </p>
<p></p>
<p>
</p><h2 id="section22">GÄRDET</h2>

  <font size="-1">Everyone who moved to Stockholm while Sweden was industrialising had to have somewhere to live. Although it was mostly on Kungsholmen and outer Norrmalm that new homes were hastily thrown up to accommodate the workers, during the thirties numerous buildings in the contemporary functionalist style, with neat rows of tenement houses, were put up the green areas north of Valhallavägen. This large are, which stretches northwards from Tessinparken, eventually came to be known as Gärdesstaden.<br>
Today Gärdet, with its wide-open spaces, is the place where you walk your dog or that it’s a good starting point for a stroll to Djurgården. Some might also mention Kaknästornet, a 155-metre-tall radio and TV tower with a rooftop restaurant and café – and a wonderful view of the city. <br>

<h2 id="section23">NYBROVIKEN</h2>
<p><br>
  <font size="-1">At Nybrokajen 11 you will find Sweden’s oldest concert hall, with its inviting atmosphere from historical times. The majestic building was inaugurated in 1878 by King Oscar II, and with that, Sweden got its first public concert hall. The handsome premises came to be used not only for concerts; even the annual Nobel Prize ceremonies took place here too, from 1901 to 1925. The building also previously accommodated the Royal Swedish Academy of Music with its Conservatory where renowned personalities like Jussi Björling, Birgit Nilsson and Eric Ericson once were students.<br>
	Almost every evening there is a concert at Nybrokajen 11, with many different musical genres sharing the beautiful hall. Come and enjoy chamber music, choir, folk music, jazz or contemporary music. In the splendid acoustics at Nybrokajen 11 it all sounds excellent!

</p><h2 id="section24">SWEDISH ART AND DESIGN</h2>
<p><br>
  <font size="-1">Sweden’s design breakthrough came in the thirties, when Swedish modernism was introduced to the world. Wares were to combine function with beauty, and Swedish glass in particular became internationally renowned.
</font> </p>
<p></p>
<p><font size="-1">In Stockholm, good design is all over, from designer shops to galleries and restaurants. Youthful design is especially prominent.
</font></p>
<p><font size="-1">On Strandvägen you’ll find Svenskt Tenn, selling high class pewter and Josef Frank’s early 20th-century fabrics. Right next door is Carl Malmstens Möbelfabrik – like Josef Frank, Carl Malmsten was pioneer of modern Swedish design, along with other such luminaries as furniture designer Bruno Mathsson and the artists who were then being taken on by the glassworks at Kosta and Orrefors.
</font></p>
<p><font size="-1">At Blasieholmen, the National Museum of Fine Arts has permanent exhibition of modern Swedish design. The big auction houses, where 20th-century designer pieces now find a ready market, are situated on Strandvägen and Arsenalgatan in neighbouring  Norrmalm. Interesting design exhibitions are often staged at Svensk Form and the Museum of Modern Art, which is currently situated on Norrmalm.

<p><font size="-1">The royal hunting ground</font><br>
</p>
<h2 id="section26">THE NATIONAL CITY PARK</h2>
<p><font size="-1">Djurgården is part of a large green are designated  a national city park – the world’s first – by royal decree in 1996. The rest of the park is made up of Ulriksdal, Haga and Brunnsviken.<br><br>
	Djurgården was taken over by the Swedish kings before the 15th century and has remained in royal hands ever since. It was initially used as a pastureland but in the 16th century was declared a royal hunting ground by King Johan III, who stocked it with reindeer and deer for the chase. A century later it was fenced in and the gate leading into the hunting ground was painted blue. The remains of the enclosure, known as the “Blue Gate”, can still be seen on the left directly after the main bridge. The present-day gate was erected in the mid-19th century.
</font></p>
<font size="-1">
<p>Not until the 18th and 19th centuries, when Djurgården became something of a centre for culture and entertainment, were any recreational buildings put up. These included inns, a circus (now a theatre), the Gröna Lund amusement park, Skansen open-air museum and the Nordic Museum. Other contemporary buildings include Rosendal Palace, Rosendal Garden (now a garden centre and café), and imposing houses for summer residents.
</p>
<p>The canal was dug in the early 19th century to link Djurgårdsbrunnsviken with Värtan, Stockholm’s gateway to the archipelago and the Baltic. The sunny northern bank of the canal, flanked by embassies and diplomatic residences, is fondly known as Snobbery Way and is a favourite Stockholm walk.

</font>
<h2 id="section27">THREE ÖRE TO DJURGÅRDEN</h2>
<p><font size="-1">Water transport gradually became more organised during the early 18th century; only a century later did public transport by land start to become common.
</font> </p>
<p></p>
<p><font size="-1">In the mid-18th century, “rowing ladies” took passengers, about ten at a time, by boat to various places in Stockholm – the fare for a trip between Skeppsbron and Djurgården was about 3 öre.
</font></p>
<p><font size="-1">By the mid-19th century steamboats had made their appearances, with more than 50 ferries plying some 20 regular routes. Even today, a ferry runs all the year round between Skeppsbron and Djurgården – a favourite way for Stockholmers to get to Skansen, Gröna Lund and the Vasa Museum.
</font></p>
<p><font size="-1">As you step off the ferry, turn right to visit “Djurgårdssstaden”, whose 18th-century buildings were to home to the workers employed at Galärvarvet ship-yard further down the road.

<h2 id="section28">STOCKHOLM’S MUSEUM DISTRICT</h2>
<p><font size="-1">Djurgården is not only Stockholm’s biggest stretch of parkland but it is also the district with the most museums. The following are a few of the most popular.
</font> </p>
<p> </p>
<h2 id="section29">SKANSEN</h2>
<p><font size="-1">The world's first open-air museum, founded in 1891 to stimulate an interest in Swedish culture, to promote various leisure activities and “to preserve buildings of cultural and historical importance”.
</font></p>
<p><font size="-1">Today’s Skansen is made up of about 150 historic buildings, where you can watch live demonstrations of traditional crafts such as flatbread baking, glass blowing and paper manufacture. The Skansen zoo is home to about 70 species of animals, mostly from Scandinavia – wolves, elks, seals, wolverines and bears. There is also an aquarium and a special section for more exotic animals, insects and reptiles.
</font></p>
<p><font size="-1">At Skansen, big national holidays such as New Year are celebrated in the traditional manner – some are even broadcast on live TV. The Advent and Christmas markets are said by many to be among Stockholm’s best.
</font></p>
<p> </p>
<h2 id="section30">PROUD VASA</h2>
<p><font size="-1">The man-of-war Vasa was built when Sweden was something of a big European power. Completed in 1628 it was the mightiest ship of its time, armed with 64 cannon on two decks and worked by a crew of 450 men, of whom 300 were soldiers. Imposing, though it was, the Vasa was not a shipbuilder’s masterpiece; setting out on its maiden voyage,, it sank like a stone before it had even left the harbour.
</font></p>
<p><font size="-1">The Vasa was raised in 1961 and is now housed in the Vasa Museum, where you can study the ship and learn more about its history and life on board. Those who died when the Vasa went down were buried in Galärvarvet cemetery not far from the museum. Here there is also a memorial to those who died in the Estonia ferry disaster in 1996.<br>

<h2 id="section33">PRINCE EUGENS WALDEMARSUDDE</h2>
<p><font size="-1">On Waldemarsudde a little step out on Djurgården are the house of
  the art interested prince's Eugene located. He build to himself in the beginning of
  1900 century. He hired the architect Ferdinad Boberg, who designed a light
  and airy house that in many ways broke against the times style ideals. The
  prince was interested in gardens - and art and painted much himself, but he had
  also many artist friends. He invited several of those artists who were
  big artists already or would become it later like Anders Zorn, Bruno
  Liljefors, Richard Bergh etc </font></p>
<p><font size="-1">After the dead of prince Eugens 1947 the house become a museum.
  In the prince art collections are approximately 6000 works of art (graphics,
  sculptures, painting etc.) of which 3000 is his own work. They are not set out
  at the same time. There are several exhibition wards, for example. The prince Studio
  highest up in the big house. Temporary exhibitions are arranged with productions that do not
  include the prince collections. To take a coffee-break in the café that are located close by is very cosy.</font></p>
<p><font size="-1">Prince Eugen was also interested in gardens. Garden architectures were very big during 1800 century and big garden plants were common. Also the
  prince erected a well thought-out park around his new houses. He was also precise
  with preserving several of the trees when space  was prepared for the
  new house. Also today the Prince Eugens Waldemarsudde is taken care of meticulous by the gardeners and they are following the prince wishes as much as they can. The wishes are left
  in detailed notes that the prince wrote by himself.</font></p>
<p><font size="-1">On Waldemarsudde stands also a mill that was built 1784. In
  the mill was produced for example linseed oil.  When the prince bought the land
  on Waldemarsudde at the end of 1800 century the mill was decayed and he got the advice to tear it down. The prince did not follow the council and renovated the mill instead. The mill is one of a total of three that is preserved in the world today.<br>

<h2 id="section34">SÖDERMALM</h2>
<p><font size="-1">In a permanent change </font> </p>
<p> </p>
<h2 id="section35">THE WORKERS DISTRICT</h2>
<p><font size="-1">The moving out  to the Malmarna outside the downtown area was
  low status for a long time and was prevented by the State through that they took the right to
  burn all settlement in critical situations and wanted to  prevent an invasion of the town. The green foliage Malmen in the south was therefore in the beginning used as a funeral place for poor and sick people and as a execution place. During 1400 century Södermalm was a pasture land  for the  Stadsholmens (old town) townsmen. </font></p>
<font size="-1"> </font>
<p><font size="-1">Södermalm begins to be built up at the end of 1500 century,
  it became a residence for fishermen and workmen that no longer had place
  on Stadsholmen or that has activities that takes a lot of space or with bad smell or is fire
  dangerous. The townmens pasture lands become also cultivated areas for vegetables,
  fruit and other things that is sold on the market places in the town. The houses
  that are built on the townsmen’s land, so called Malm farms, becomes more common.
  Many of them exists even today and if you are curious you can do a visit.</font></p>
<p><font size="-1">The other Malmarna is for a long time the State´s property thats why Södermalm was a district that was built up pretty early, despite its very convex
  terrain. During the 1600 century all the poor maids, the farmhands, the fishermen and the hauler contractors (often of Finnish origins) are the ones moving into Södermalm.
  Södermalm denotes itself as the town part of the poor workers'.</font></p>
<p><font size="-1">On the 1600 century a new and more consistent, right-angled street net  is erected in the town. That means that the buildings of the poor people on Södermalm
  have to move to the border of the  Malm. The street net is partial left
  today for example on the Hornsgatan and Götgatan. With this the districts status is increased
  and a palace or two was built up in a power spirit.
  The palace of Louis the Geer on Götgatan are still standing today.The most common accommodation form on Södermalm are at the moment small wooden houses.</font></p>
<p><font size="-1">The town's wholesale dealer and the drapers shops may during the 1700 century have special privileges and are established on Södermalm, particularly on the towns eastern parts. One of the more well-known is Barnängens draper shop that expands
  in a big area. It is now  Södermalm reinforces it’s role as the workers'
  town part. In many of the wooden houses that exists here, for emample. in The Vita
Bergen, are the factory workers living. They have low salaries and cannot get their
  own commerce trade in the same way that wholesale dealers can. It is above
  all wool and silk that is processed to fabrics in the first factories on Södermalm.
  During the era of the industrialism on the 1800 century are many industries established with
  associated labor on the heights of the south. One of the many textile industries that
  was established on Södermalm is active today. On Almgren's silk-weaving mill
  on Repslagargatan near Slussen the production is still rolling and there is also
  a museum that tells about the activity since the start 1833.</font></p>
<p><font size="-1">At the end of the 1800 century is Södermalm one of the richest
  town parts along with Norrmalm with most inhabitants. Nevertheless are here still cultivations, for example of tobacco to Ljunglöfs tobacco factory. Münchenbryggeriet is one of the well-known breweries in Stockholm, the building along Söder Mälarstrand
  holds today everything from school to dance palaces. At Heleneborg the Nobel explosive-factory located, that however have been moved several times because of the risk of explosions. The workers are still dominating The Södermalm and lives often during under quite miserable circumstances.
  Many lives in so called need rooms that are built in the town in order to take care of
  the very poorest. Because shortage of houses becomes worse for each day.<br>
  </font></p>
<h2 id="section36">SÖDER BECOMES HIPPT</h2>
<p><font size="-1">During the 1900 century the hygiene is improved and also healthcare and the water in Stockholm, that leads to an improved living standard for the town's inhabitants. But the town is still overcrowded and the shortage of houses are desperate. The industries moves to cheaper land outside the town.
  The drained industrial areas are used during the 1900 century to build more houses on Södermalm. </font></p>
<p><font size="-1">During the 1920:s  had the inhabitants of  Södermalm the lowest average income of everyone in Stockholm. Today, it is no longer so. To Södermalm has cultural
  workers, restaurant - and pubs,  trendy bohemians, galleris, the gay culture
  and the multi cultural of Stockholm moved in.</font></p>
<p><font size="-1">Along Åsögatan, Bondegatan, Skånegatan and around Nytorget
  are small design aware shops with restaurants crowded. The area are called sometimes”
  SOFO”, South of Folkungagatan, which is Stockholms correspondence to New York's trendy SOHO. Around Mariatorget and along Götgatan against Medborgarplatsen
  is  also very active both day and night. More galleries and handicraft
  shops you will find on Hornsgatan close to Slussen. On” Hornsgatspuckeln”
  you will find glass artists, potters, silversmiths, sculptures and galleries with
  one and another trendy café.<br>
  </font> </p>
<h2 id="section37">LOTS OF PUBS AND POPULAR</h2>
<p><font size="-1">Apart from the royal wedding festivities and coronations the inhabitants of Stockholm amused themselves during 1700 century with theatre, circus,  walks, skate sliding on the ices and of course of all restaurants in the town. The drunkenness was spread out, perhaps to get a pause from the hard everyday life in the overcrowded town? </font></p>
<p><font size="-1">One of them that describes this everyday existence is the poet
  Carl Mikael Bellman, who had the time to got into bankruptcy not once but twice
  before he dies in pulmonary 1795 only 55 years old. Bellman gets  Gustav the III as a protectors and belongs to one of the more well-known poets of Stockholm already on the 1700 century. He has retained his position since then. Bellman lives on Södermalm during the bigger part of his life.  A life he shares with the frayed but with love described characters
  that often occurs in his texts. A street is today namned after him and on
  Södermalm (Långholmen) are the Bellman museum located. Royal Djurgården are otherwise
  the place that have often been associated with Bellman. Because of he spent a lot of time here and often wrote about how the inhabitants of Stockholm - rich as poor <br>
  - went here to divert themselves. On Djurgården, a statue
  of Bellman was raised 1829. </font></p>
<p><font size="-1">Södermalm is today one of Stockholms most crowded area of restaurant - and pubs. Along Götgatan and around Medborgarplatsen are they perhaps more
  frequent than somewhere else. Södermalm holds a broad spectrum of restaurants
  and bars. Classic beer halls as the Pelikan mill shows that on Södermalm is a very
  strong pub culture alive. Despite the huge range of pubs you can count on that
  it will be full almost everywhere, also during week days. A trip to above
  mentioned “ SOFO” is also a hot advice.</font></p>
<p><font size="-1">Södermalm has also one multi cultural stamp. There is no hazard that
  the towns first mosque was inaugurated here at the year of 2000. Are you standing at Medborgarplatsen  you can see the minaret sticking up among the trees in the garden Björns Trädgård.. You that search for musical from all corners of the world should do a visit in the shop  Multikulti at S:t Paulsgatan, or perhaps to the Kairo Bazaar at Långholmsgatan.
  Don´t miss a visit on the Södra Teatern at the legendary Mosebacke.<br>
  </font> </p>
<h2 id="section38">SLUSSEN, LOVED AND HATED</h2>
<p><font size="-1">The place between Södermalm and old town was from the start
  one of the most used ways for boats that came with products for the town in Mälaren. When the town of Stockholm grew a lot of off the goods for consumption stayed in Stockholm or for further transportation to the provinces. Because of that Södermalmstorg also became a transshipment place. </font></p>
<p><font size="-1">The passage with the pouring water became more difficult
  to pass. At the beginning of the 1600 century had the territory increased so much and made the stream so powerful so that a lock became necessary. It stood completed 1642. New
  locks was inaugurated 1744, 1793 and 1850. At 1920 it became traffic stocking on land every time when the bridges was opend. The lock foundation and the traffic merry-go-round that was inaugurated 1935 becomes an international admired construction.</font></p>
<p><font size="-1">Slussen is today one big traffic junction for buses, underground and trains eastbound. Both loved as hated. Here glares Hornsgatan and Götgatan together and the night life is itinerant.</font></p>
<p><font size="-1">To take the elevator Katarinahissen to the the mile wide view at the top
  is very special. Why not stay a while on the restaurant Gondolen? The restaurant
  is not only well-known for its good food, but also for its well-assorted drink
  list and the comfortable leather arm-chairs with view over the town. The elevator Katarina
  hissen was built already 1883, but was torn down and rebuilt in connection
  with the big rebuilding of Slussen in the middle of 1930-talet.</font></p>
<p> </p>
<h2 id="section39">LÅNGHOLMEN AND REIMERSHOLME</h2>
<p><font size="-1">In the area between Långholmsgatan and the water on the
  west side of the South (Bergsundstrand) has recently become a more trendier place to live in and has a lot of cozy cafés to warm up in, in the winter time. Here, you can go down to the ice and to go for a walk all the way to Skanstull if you want to and if the ice is hard enough.
  You can also go for a walk along the water side through Tanto, past the colony allotments  to the newly built Eriksdalsbadet.
  On the so called Health Path you can actually go around the entire Södermalm if you want to.</font></p>
<p><font size="-1">It is from Bergsundstrand from the west you can go through the idyllic
  Reimersholme. Reimersholme is baptized after Anders Reimers that bought big
  parts of the island at the end of the 1700 century. On the island, several or-farms and industries was located. The aquavit factory that produced so called Absolut Renat, later called Absolut, is probably the most well-known.
  Today it is most houses here, many built in the middle of 1900 century and
  ahead.</font></p>
<p><font size="-1">Next to Reimersholme lies Långholmen, that from 1724 to 1975
  was a prison island. The the biggest prison building was the central prison with
  more than 500 cells, was built 1874 but does not exist today. On the other hand,
  you can visit the old local prison, that also holds a museum. The prisoners worked
 for example in the factories that was situated on Reimersholme. On that time also a
  bridge existed between the both islands.</font></p>
<p> </p>
<h2 id="section40">HORNSTULL</h2>
<p><font size="-1">Officially Hornstull is the name on of the crossing were Hornsgatan
  and Långholmsgatan meets, now it is the name of the South’s west part south of
  Långholmsgatan. </font></p>
<p><font size="-1">From once have been called Knivsöder, Hornstull is today
  a stedy part of the South with much activity. To Hornstull have many artists,
  media people and creators moved and the area becomes increasingly
  fresching up and the rented homes are changed to tenant-owner homes.</font></p>
<p><font size="-1">Hornstull is today the answer of the west part of the Souths SOFO but with more soft business and more heart. It swarms of cozy café´s, small galleries,
  nice restaurants, thickly foliaged green areas along Hornstullstrand and many
  innovated small businesses. A good example is Hornstulls Milk Bar on Verkstadsgatan
  - a youthful café where you can sit down for a cup of delicious coffee, play
  pacman and listen to everything from electronic music to jazz. Or the Iglo Light Café
  where the inhabitants tired of the darkness can sit down for an hour of  lightning with
  something rich of vitamin to drink.</font></p>
<p><font size="-1">Street must also be mentioned with a swarming street life by the
  water between Liljeholmsbadet and Liljeholmsbron _ The Camden caps or Greenwich Village of Stockholm. One indoor - and  one outdoor market, where
  you can each weekend all year around (however closed January) find everything
  - both new and second-hand, often direct from the creator/designer, or only
  to take a cup of coffee,  in one secondhand chair by the water at the Street Café.</font></p>
<p><font size="-1">The Streets restaurant is open the entire week all year around with
  dishes based on daily fresh, seasonally, most often ecological raw materials
  direct from local farmers.</font></p>
<p><font size="-1">Finally: take a look at the powerful mosaic along
  the beach. It is with its over 500 square meters the biggest creation in Scandinavia of young artists and mosaic builders with roots from other cultures. With Swedish summer meadow flowers and mirror glass in between it gives a deep - and light effect, that shines up Street and makes the place to feel bigger.</font></p>
<p></p>
<p> </p>
<h2 id="section41">NORRMALM</h2>
<p><font size="-1">Downtown area - swarming stone town</font></p>
<p> </p>
<h2 id="section42">THE SEK's MEN MOVE IN</h2>
<p><font size="-1">At the end of the 1500 century Stadsholmen (old
  town) became crowded and the moving out to Malmarna begins. Norrmalm is the town district that first was inhabited by – the personnel of the castle and the State, the army and the fleet.
  Here are also most of the workshops that produced material to the arm force, that
  would grow during the great power time on the 1600 century. On Blasieholmen during a long time was the fleet located and here was also the big ship-on-the-line Vasa built. The ship sinks on it’s maiden tour on May 7th, 1628.
  In the Vasa Museum on Djurgården more is told about the ship's history and the life
  on board. </font></p>
<p><font size="-1">The State donated during this time also a lot of land to the town
  that made it possible to built more on the Malmarna, especially Norrmalm. One right-angled
  street net was erected according to those days' ideal for a powerful capital.
  In a building appliance 1736 they tried to govern up the buildings from the aspects of –security, hygiene-, and beauty. The breadth on the new streets was regulated, requirements were set on fire dangerous activities, wastes would be handled more discreet, the town would be embellished etc. New houses would also be built in stone as much as possible, that was done on Norrmalm but not on the other Malmarna.
Stockholm and Norrmalm in particular, are referred often to the Stone City.<br>
  </font> </p>
<h2 id="section43">ALWAYS ONE ENTERTAINMENT CENTER</h2>
<p><font size="-1">It is not awkward that Norrmalm always have been a place with lively
  business. Until 1935 was the extension Norrmalm - old Stan  - Södermalm the only way to move in north southern direction through the town. </font></p>
<p><font size="-1">The wholesaler dealers resident was on Stadsholmen and on Norrmalm was the small dealers resident during the 1600 century. More and
  more people moved and was active here in the town of the Officials and Military and the need of amusements increased, On a list over places that served alcoholic beverage from 1671 are mentioned over 300 restaurants, wine cellars etc. After Stadsholmen are Norrmalm and lower Östermalm at this time the most crowded ares with restaurants.
These traditions has continued to be alive on Norrmalm. The areas around Stureplan and Hötorget are the richest areas of entertainment,  although restaurants - and  entertainment are blossom also in other parts of the town.</font></p>
<p><font size="-1">Around those big industries that settles down at the edge of Norrmalm
  during the 1800 - and 1900 centuries, houses for workers, service establishments,
  entertainments grows up. Norrmalm becomes more and more populated and therefore has a lot of boutiques, cafés - and entertainment areas as for example on Rörstrandsgatan and Odengatan grown up. Since the different areas have been forced to be built up quickly it has a relatively homogeneous nature. They most well-known are the Atlasbergen by the Atlas Copco's  factories and Birkastan where the  Rörstrands China factory was located. It is also
  this that much characterizes Norrmalm: different areas with  a rich variation of profile.</font></p>
<p> </p>
<h2 id="section44">SHOPS, SHOPS, SHOPS</h2>
<p><font size="-1">Stockholm has a long and interesting history behind itself
  when it comes to retail trade. During the 1900 century moves the trade from the old town
  to Norrmalm. Many strong shopping areas was built up and strongest of them they
  all became Drottninggatan, Hamngatan and Biblioteksgatan. At the same time became the

<p><font size="-1">Hötorget has always been an important trade place. During
  1880 one big  market hall was built in order to improve the assortment on
  Hötorget. It was torn down 1953 and the new maket hall that are under the ground
  level is now well-known for its international nature where you can buy everything from mumskull to green tea. On the square are fruit and flowers still soled.</font></p>
<p><font size="-1">A safe sign of spring is that the stairs before Konserthuset becomes
  croweded with inhabitants who had escaped from the offices for a while, perhaps eating one
  kebab or a fruit bought in Hötorgshallen. It is also here one off Stockholm's
  biggest cinema palaces are located, what is left of the cinema culture that has its prime time on Norrmalm during the middle of the 1900 century.</font><font size="-1"><br>

<h2 id="section46">KULTURHUSET ON NEW NORRMALM</h2>
<p><font size="-1">Hötorgscity is the name of the new area around  Hötorget that during 1950 - and 60:s undergoes one extensive demolition and renewal in connection with the opening of new underground stations and new street extensions in order to take care of the increased traffic. The buildings are at this time quite worn out on Norrmalm and it is considered that there is a need to increase the number of offices and shop premises in order to that not Norrmalm will lose it’s status as a center for business. You must remember that the
  buildings at this time still is quite low.</font></p>
<p><font size="-1">Despite violent protests, almost the entire area is full of deep holes that are not built on because of political misjudgments and investors that have pull out. Most of the waste areas are used as parking place during many years. From the ashes however new buildings like the five scrapes by Hötorget and Kulturhuset are growing up and they are well-visited and are a popular meeting place for people and culture. If you have the time
  you  can also play chess.

<p><font size="-1">The Sergeltorg that now is built is namned after the building that
  earlier stood here and was one of the houses that were considered have biggest ancient monument value (for example the artist Johan Tobias Sergel from the 1700 century had his studio). The town has had an architecture competition for reconstructions of the square, but the long hated black-and-white pattern has received a cult status. Today, you can buy trays and rugs with pattern in trendy design shops. In the middle of Sergelstorg stands the
  fountain of the architect David Helldén with a glass pillar designed by Edwin Öhrström.

<h2 id="section48">BATHING PLACE</h2>
<p><font size="-1">For you that visits Stockholm during winter is a visit to one of the
 town's historical bath institutions a hot advice. In the 1600 century in Stockholm
a special trade group of  - bath masters - that offers bathing, shaving, haircutting
  are established. Until the 1900 century is the poor hygiene in the crowded city
  a source to infection and health problems. The general
  baths that opens in Stockholm are Sturebadet (1885), Centralbadet (1904) and
  Liljeholmsbadet (1929) the most famous. The equipment is preserved or renovated according to original blueprints and is an experience in itself. Why not a steam sauna and
  massage after a day on the ices of Stockholm? </font> </p>
<p><font size="-1"><br>
  </font> </p>
<h2 id="section49">GO FISHING IN THE MIDDLE OF THE TOWN</h2>
<p><font size="-1">Stockholm are a town on the water, and on cold winters a town
  on ice. The ice has not only been a way of transportation, but has also
  been a source to a lot of entertainment. During the 1800 century was ice skating places ploughed up during the winter time and ice skating competitions was held. During the summer time many people are swimming and bathing on the rocks and beaches. Politicians have been seen demonstrating the fine quality of the water by drinking a glass of water from the Stream (Strömmen).
At both summer and winter time you can also see fishermen along the docks around the
  Stream (Strömmen). Here, anyone may go fishing with hand tools (maximum 10 hooks). For more sophisticated fishing a special card for fishing is required. The most common catch
  is salmon, red herring, baltic herring and perch. The record for salmon
  is 20 kilos! Each year is herring planted in the Stream (Strömmen), normally in the turn
  of the month of April/May. It is quite sensational to see the fish been released down in the whirling spring streams, in the middle of the town. </font></p>

  the entire Brunnsviken in a couple of hours. Best is perhaps to take a trip with the
  ship” Sjöfröken”. Guides tell about buildings, nature, café and other things of interest around the bay and the different bridges. Gustav III erected the Haga Park at the end of the 1700 century according to the English style and ideals.

<p><font size="-1"><br>
  <strong>STROKES in THE ARCHIPELAGO</strong></font></p>
<p><font size="-1">The archipelago in Stockholm is beautiful on both summer and winter. Perhaps more beautiful one a quiet and shimmering cold winter day, when
  the ice-floes sail around on the bays and gets the hull of the ship to sing. It is not
strange that several of the Swedish artists like Anders Zorn, Bruno Liljefors, Carl Larsson
  and others have been inspired and referred to in their art!</font></p>
<p><font size="-1">The Archipelago in Stockholm is relatively unchanged and is one
  of few places where you can even during high season find your own bay or natural harbor to anchor in. From Arholma in the  north to Landsort in the south is it just over 80 km, so it is a lot to investigate!</font></p>
<p><font size="-1">For you as a tourist, there is during the summer season a rich
  range of activities, lodging and museums etc. There are many islands were you can take a bath at and go to with a boat. Also in the winter, you can visit the archipelago, since
  several islands offers accommodation all year around. One and another archipelago
restaurant has also open during the winter. We now will do a stopp on some of the islands in the  rchipelago. Total is it 24000 islands, islets and rocks in archipelago!</font></p>
<p> </p>
<h2 id="section52">THE THREE FACES OF THE ARCHIPELAGO</h2>
<p><font size="-1">If you take a trip with a ship from the central of Stockholm to outposts
  like Svartlöga or Rödlöga, you can discern three natural zones.
  The innerside archipelago is luxuriant and here grows as well spruce, pine and broad-leafs for example birch, oak and aspen. The islands are thickly-wooded and it is common
  with alder by the edge of the beach. On these islands, the inhabitants erected
  cultivations on previous marine bottom. Most often, it was hay was to the animals,
  that gave eggs and butter to sale in the large town. </font></p>
<font size="-1"> </font>
<p><font size="-1">Little further out the nature is characterized with a little dryer
  thicket,knotty birch, aspen, sallow, common alder and fern. It is also here you find tistron (the archipelago 's wild black currant), bushes, rose and stone raspberries.</font></p>
<p><font size="-1">The outer archipelagos nature is like the mountains windswept and barren. Here exist only lavas and algae, rice and mountain ash on the bare rocks. One and another lighthouse and shed shows about the people's presence here, often one lighthouse keeper who lived very a very single life. Islanders from the Middle Ages paid taxes in the form of for example seal fat, salted baltic herring and dried pike, what gives a picture of how they were feed.</font></p>
<p><font size="-1">The Archipelago of Stockholm is near 2 billions years old! In this
  old primary rocks of granite and gneiss we can today see tracks of its creation. In crevices in the granite can you see dark streaks of other mountain articles that have been pressed up from the inside of the earth. On the rocks you can also see deep grooves in clear tracks after the interior ice. When the ice melted turned deep pots out in to the rocks in vertical water streams.  Normally, they have a diameter on approximately a meter, but there is several bigger; like“
  the Sea-Ladys-Cave” in Sandhamn and” the Soruce-from-Hell” on Öja (Landsort)
  in order to mention some. An archaeologist pumped out everything 1908 from the giant pot the Soruce-from-Hell and find several coins on the bottom, the oldest is from 1400-talet!</font></p>
<p><font size="-1"> </font> </p>
<h2 id="section53">FROM VIKINGS TO WHOLESALE DEALERS</h2>
<p><font size="-1">Remains and tax lengths show that the bigger islands in
  Stockholm's archipelago was inhabited already before the average time. Stockholm's
  archipelago has today totally approximately 12 000 people that lives there all year around, of which near 7 000 building on the islands are entire without country conjunction (no bridge
  or tunnels). The summer visitors are the more part and there is around 30 000 country cottages spread out on the islands. The buildings give a picture of the archipelago's development. The first fishermen in the outer archipelago built simple tool sheds. On the islands that aimed for agriculture you will find low cottages in timber and panel. On Möja and many other islands in the middle of the Archipelago are more examples to find. Piers with boat-houses from this time are also preserved along the beaches in archipelago. Magnificant places in the country for upper class were built in the archipelago already during the 1700century.</font></p>
<p><font size="-1">But it was due to the steam ship, the townsmen at
  the end of the 1800 century got access to the archipelago further out. Along for example
  at Stegesund  you can see examples on decorative carving in the magnificent houses of the wholesale dealers. The houses was not seldom architect drawn and could have towers, point arcs, summer houses and swimming-pools.
  The sawmill industries, that was growing at the end of the 1800 century, was machine producing spare parts that could be composed after own taste. From 1930 became it easy
  to buy land in the archipelago. Also the middle class could buy property, and
  built houses with material they could afford to buy. The Weekend cottage
  became common in big areas, like on Vindö, Djurö and Sandhamn.</font></p>
